This maven project shows the server side prepared statement bug in the postgres jdbc driver 9.4-1205-jdbc42 regarding numeric returns being off by 10x

Change configuration in Config.java

It connects to postgres on localhost using postgres:postgres but it doesn't actually need to use any tables.

Adjust prepareThreshold=3 on the jdbc url to see the problem in action.

You can change the postgres jdbc driver version in pom.xml

Simply run this project with: mvn spring-boot:run
